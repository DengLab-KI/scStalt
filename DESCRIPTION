Description: scStalt porvides a scalable ultrafast method to annotate cell 
    states under the reference-query mode. It extracts the trajectory associated
    differentially expressed genes from reference dataset and then smoothed the 
    genes to form a kernel expression profile with which query cells are 
    assigned to their corresponding stages. The methodw performs with high 
    accurcy and inference on the batch effects.
