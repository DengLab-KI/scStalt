# scStalt

scStalt porvides a scalable ultrafast method to annotate cell states under the reference-query mode. 
It extracts the trajectory associated differentially expressed genes from reference dataset and then 
smoothed the genes to form a kernel expression profile with which query cells are assigned to their 
corresponding stages. The method can also be utilized to perform integration with mosaic datasets.
